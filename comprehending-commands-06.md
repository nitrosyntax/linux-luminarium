## Comprehending Commands

Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by touching it with the touch command:

hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$
It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

### Terminal output

`cd /tmp`

`touch pwn college`

`/challenge/run`

## Flag

> pwn.college{A5VaqeffiimZP4dxbj6C8OzKuSX.QXwMDO0wiM3MjMwEzW}
